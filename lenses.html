        <h1>Optical Lenses</h1>
        <p>As an independent optometry practice, we can offer more choices to suit the patient’s individual needs. We are able to offer high quality lenses from lens companies such as HOYA (Japan), Essilor (France) and Rodenstock (Germany).</p>
        <p>Every company has lenses with different advantages, and we will offer the most suitable lens option with the best quality coatings where possible. We can also accommodate patients with specific preferences in lens type or brands to the best of our ability.</p>

        <h2>Single vision lenses</h2>
        <p>Single vision lenses are lenses designed to correct one specific vision problem- generally Distance, Near or Intermediate. These lenses allow correction for myopia (shortsightedness), hyperopia (longsightedness) and astigmatism.</p>
        <h2>Bifocal lenses</h2>
        <p>Bifocal lenses are lenses designed to correct two different vision problems- generally Distance and Near. They have two distinct areas on the lens, each with a different prescription power and are suitable for patients with presbyopia and require two specific viewing distances. They are sometimes confused with multifocal lenses but are easily distinguishable by their appearance.</p>
        <h2>Multifocal/Progressive lenses</h2>
        <p>Multifocal lenses, also commonly known as progressive lenses, are lenses designed to correct vision problems at multiple distances. They are suitable mostly for patients with presbyopia but can also be for patients who suffer from eye strain and eye fatigue from near tasks. Unlike traditional bifocal lenses, multifocal lenses do have any visible lines or segments which allows the smoother transition between different powers.

            Multifocal lenses are highly customised lenses and every lens company’s multifocal lenses are different. Even within each company there are multiple multifocal lens designs. We offer high quality multifocal lenses which will best suit your needs.</p>
