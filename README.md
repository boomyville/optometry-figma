# Figma Webpage Conversion
A conversion of a Figma website design by a professional UX designer to a HTML/CSS/Javascript website

After my initial Optometry business landing page, I was given feedback to update the design to something more modern.

So the client had a professional UX designer craft a website design and then asked me to 'deploy the figma design'.

So I created everything from scratch using the Figma template as a blueprint on how to design the webpage
