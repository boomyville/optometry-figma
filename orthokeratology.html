        <h1>Orthokeratology</h1>
        <p>Orthokeratology lenses, also known as Ortho-K or OK lenses, are a specialised and reversible method of vision correction that primarily addresses myopia (shortsightedness). Described as “braces for the eyes”, they slowly shape the cornea of the eye to the desired level. </p>
        <p>Ortho-K correction involves using a specially designed hard rigid gas permeable contact lenses worn overnight during sleep to provide clear vision during the day without the need of any spectacles or contact lenses. While this is the main effect of OK lenses, they are also often used for their secondary effect of reducing myopia progression in children.</p>
        <ul>

            <li class="tick">Proven to slow short sightedness progression</li>

            <li class="tick">Reversible treatment</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What's the process?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>During the initial consultation we will do a standard full eye examination to check the patient’s vision and eye health. Using this information, we can determine if the patient is eligible for OK lenses as well as discuss the other options available.</li>
            <li>During the first Ortho-K consultation, we will do corneal topography to take a map of the patient’s cornea. This accurately measures the unique parameters of the patient so we can design a fully customised lens to fit these requirements.</li>
            <li>After the lenses are made, the patient is required to have an appointment where we teach the patient and/or the patient’s guardians how to insert and remove the lens. We will teach the patient how to clean and take care of the lens, as well as take some extra measurements to verify the fit. We recommend the patient to wear this lens overnight, hopefully having 8 hours of sleep and to come in for an appointment the following morning.</li>
            <li>The following morning the patient is recommended to come in wearing the Ortho-K lenses if possible so we can provide an assessment on how the lens has worked overnight while also addressing any issues the patient may have over the night. If there are no issues and the lens is working as desired, we have completed the fit. We still require further appointments at regular intervals to assess that the lens is functioning as desired. If at any time the vision is not ideal, the fit may need to be adjusted for as long as necessary to achieve the target.</li>
