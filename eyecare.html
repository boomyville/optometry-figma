        <h1>Eyecare</h1>
        <p>At C Wel Optometry, we provide comprehensive, detailed eye examinations where we check the prescription of the eyes as well as routinely look for any signs of eye health problems.</p>
        <p>The majority of eye health issues rely on early detection and prevention, so it is recommended to have a routine full eye test done every 2 years. With certain eye conditions it may even be recommended to have a test every year instead. As part of the eye examination, we take a detailed patient history to find and address any concerns and we will attempt to find the best possible solution. As an independent optometry store, we are able to provide a wider range of products and services to find the best solution for the patientâ€™s needs.</p>
        
        <p>As part of our thorough eye examination and management we offer the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT)</li>
            <li>Contact Lenses</li>
            <li>Myopia Control</li>
            <li>A wide range of frames and lenses for spectacles</li>
            <li>Orthokeratology</li>

        </ul>
        <p>We will always try to put the needs of the patient first where possible and will often recommend different options and educate the patient on the pros and cons of each alternative. Sometimes this might be overwhelming, but we like to involve the patient in the decision making process. However, if necessary, we can consider all the important factors and come up with what we feel is the best option.</p>
